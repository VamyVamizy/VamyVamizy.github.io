                <p>Get To school is a school project for me to learn how to use RPG Maker.
                    The game is about you, the Main Character, trying to make their way to school.
                    You have to battle through dungeons and solve many puzzles to make your way to school and arrive on time.
                    You can uncover many hidden treasures to aid you on your way to school.</p>
